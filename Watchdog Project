# 🕵️‍♂️ WATCHDOG — Public Bill & Law Tracker
> Keeping governments accountable by tracking how and when laws are passed.

---

### 👀 The Problem
Governments sometimes pass bills with minimal public attention — late at night, during holidays, or with limited debate.  
Ordinary citizens rarely notice until those laws are already in force.

### 💡 The Idea
**Watchdog** is an open-source transparency tool that:
- Tracks government bill data (federal and state)
- Flags suspicious patterns — like rushed approvals or quiet timing
- Alerts the public through a simple, shareable dashboard

This project is civic, not political.  
It’s about **visibility, accountability, and awareness**.

## ✅ Current Status
**Stage:** Concept + prototype  
**Built so far:**
- A clean React front-end (sample data & flagging rules)
- A detailed project brief (PDF)
- Detection logic for:
  - Late-night votes (22:00–06:00)
  - Fast-tracked bills (<48 hours)
  - Heavy text changes (>20%)
  - Bills passed on public holidays

**Next steps:**
- Connect live legislative data feeds (Federal Register, Parliament APIs, state equivalents)
- Automate the flagging engine
- Add simple database + backend storage
- Public web dashboard and daily alerts
