# 🕵️‍♂️ WATCHDOG — Public Bill & Law Tracker
> Keeping governments accountable by tracking how and when laws are passed.

---

### 👀 The Problem
Governments sometimes pass bills with minimal public attention — late at night, during holidays, or with limited debate.  
Ordinary citizens rarely notice until those laws are already in force.

### 💡 The Idea
**Watchdog** is an open-source transparency tool that:
- Tracks government bill data (federal and state)
- Flags suspicious patterns — like rushed approvals or quiet timing
- Alerts the public through a simple, shareable dashboard

This project is civic, not political.  
It’s about **visibility, accountability, and awareness**.

---

## ✅ Current Status
**Stage:** Concept + prototype  
**Built so far:**
- A clean React front-end (sample data & flagging rules)
- A detailed project brief (PDF)
- Detection logic for:
  - Late-night votes (22:00–06:00)
  - Fast-tracked bills (<48 hours)
  - Heavy text changes (>20%)
  - Bills passed on public holidays

**Next steps:**
- Connect live legislative data feeds (Federal Register, Parliament APIs, state equivalents)
- Automate the flagging engine
- Add simple database + backend storage
- Public web dashboard and daily alerts

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack (suggested)
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind (working prototype included)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Feeds:** 
  - [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au)
  - [Parliament of Australia Bills & Hansard](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation)
  - [They Vote For You API](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au)
  - State parliaments (QLD, NSW, VIC, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started (Prototype)
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/watchdog.git
   cd watchdog
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
   You’ll see sample bills and demo alerts.

## 🌱 What’s Next?
- **First focus:** Make sure the public can see bills passed quietly, outside normal scrutiny.
- **Future expansions:** Add detection for bills about child safety, elder abuse, environmental issues, and more—*guided by community feedback*.

---

## 🤝 How to Get Involved (No Coding Required!)
- **Share your concerns:** Suggest topics or patterns Watchdog should track.
- **Give feedback:** Tell us what’s confusing or what you’d like to see improved.
- **Spread the word:** Encourage others to join or review the dashboard.
- **Help with plain-English explanations and advocacy.**

**Developers, data people, designers, writers, and everyday citizens are all welcome!**
