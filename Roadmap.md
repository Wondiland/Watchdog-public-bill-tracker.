## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Challenges

**Technical:**
- Government APIs are often unreliable or poorly documented
- Data formats vary wildly between jurisdictions
- Parsing bill text accurately is hard (legal language is complex)
- Scaling to handle high traffic during major political events

**Political:**
- Potential pushback from governments (unlikely but possible)
- Accusations of bias (we must remain neutral)
- Legal challenges re: copyright on bill text (probably fine but worth checking)

**Sustainability:**
- Open source projects often lose momentum after initial excitement
- Ongoing maintenance costs money
- Burnout risk for core contributors

**Mitigation:**
- Start small (Federal only)
- Document everything obsessively
- Build a community, not a solo project
- Secure funding early
- Stay strictly non-partisan
